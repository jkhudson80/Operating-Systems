  - PART8: Pipes
    - Everything implemented except double pipe. Can find out commented out attempt at double pipe on line (xxx)
  - PART9: Background Process
    - Checks to see any syntax errors
    - ignores beginning '&' sign
    - makes sure '&' sign is only at the end and marks the instruction as a background process instruction
    x- DOES NOT actually implement the background process
  - PART10: Exit
    - Exit does not actually wait for background processes
  - PART10: Alias
